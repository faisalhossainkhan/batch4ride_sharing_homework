# batch4_ride_sharing_homework

A bike servicing project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a bike care application. A complete, responsive Flutter UI with two pages. 
Here's what I've implemented:

Primary Purple: #6C5CE7 - Used for app bar, buttons, and accents. 
Secondary Green: #00B894 - Used for discount badges and success states. 
Accent Red: #FF7675 - Used for notifications and alerts Rating. 
Orange: #FFA500 - Used for star ratings. 
Text Colors: Dark gray (#2D3436) for primary text.
lighter gray (#636E72) for secondary text Background: White with light gray (#F8F9FA) for cards.

Typography

Heading 1: 24px, Bold - For main page titles Heading 2: 18px, 
Bold - For section headers Heading 3: 16px, 
Semi-bold - For card titles Body Large: 16px, 
Regular - For important body text Body Medium: 14px, 
Regular - For general content Caption: 12px, 
Regular - For secondary info Price: 18px, Bold - For pricing display

Responsive Design: Uses LayoutBuilder and Expanded widgets to adapt to different screen sizes. 
Fixed Image Sizes: All images have constrained dimensions to prevent overflow. 
Navigation: Two pages (Home and Care) with proper AppBar navigation.

Sections Include: 
Nearby Users with avatar circles Deals of the Day with product cards Upcoming Events with image cards Service Packages grid.








Interactive Elements: Shopping cart badge, rating display, discount labels
Scroll Views: SingleChildScrollView for vertical scrolling, ListView for horizontal scrolling sections
